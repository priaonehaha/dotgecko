	 * This represents a sequence of ASN.1 objects,
	 * where ASN.1 is "Abstract Syntax Notation number One".
	 *
	 * Overview of how this ASN1 interface is intended to
	 * work.
	 *
	 * First off, the nsIASN1Sequence is any type in ASN1
	 * that consists of sub-elements (ie SEQUENCE, SET)
	 * nsIASN1Printable Items are all the other types that
	 * can be viewed by themselves without interpreting further.
	 * Examples would include INTEGER, UTF-8 STRING, OID.
	 * These are not intended to directly reflect the numberous
	 * types that exist in ASN1, but merely an interface to ease
	 * producing a tree display the ASN1 structure of any DER
	 * object.
	 *
	 * The additional state information carried in this interface
	 * makes it fit for being used as the data structure
	 * when working with visual reprenstation of ASN.1 objects
	 * in a human user interface, like in a tree widget
	 * where open/close state of nodes must be remembered.
	 *
